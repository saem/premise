# Premise

A tool to help visualize arguments and demonstrate how one might end up at a particular world view. The idea is not my own, it's all thanks to [@_gtz_](https://twitter.com/_gtz_) and her quest to try and engage people in meaningful discourse to gain understanding rather than bicker.

## Technical

This is an example of how one might integrate d3 and angularjs, in particular the directed force graph visualization. The idea is not only to have something functional, wonderfully declarative, but also performant. The last item is rather tricky as poorly setup watches and excessive work in apply and link can cause substantial DOM changes and other computation.

## TODO

- Everything!
- Timeline Visualization
- Graph editing
- Critical path detection
- Highlighting shortest path between initial premise and conclusion (leaf node to leaf node)
